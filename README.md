# Simulation-of-Water-Droplet-Impact-on-Hydophilic-and-Hydrophobic-Surface

Description:
Simulation of water droplet on both hydrophilic (contact angle = 45deg) and hydrophobic (contact angle = 135deg) is shown in the video. The water droplet is falling from s height of 5cm (center of the water Droplet) from the surface. Adaptive Mesh Refinement is used to refine the mesh based on the Volume Fraction of water. 

Softwares: 
Mesh Generation: blockMesh 
Solver: interFoam (OpenFOAM v1806) 
Post: Paraview and blender
